# German Traffic Sign Classification

In this script, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify German traffic signs (43 categories). The emphasis of this script is to gain an understanding of how to build a simple model, rather than a very clever implementation. 

For further details, please have a look at the script which contains more explanations!

Thank you very much.
